The goal of this repository is basically to share some simple algorthims.

ReachtoSum.py: A script to find 2 numbers in a given list to reach the given sum value in an efficient way.

largest_submatrix.py: Do you want to reach the submatrix with the largest possible sum from a given NxN matrix of positive and negative integers? This one is for you.

condensed_time_ranges.py: Let's say you need a tool to find available hours for everyone in your organization. This script returns a list of condensed ranges for given a list of meeting time ranges of people in the organization. 

MeanAveragePrecision.py: This computes the average precision at different k values. To compute the mean average precision at k, it can be utilized.
